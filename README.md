[OSC][osc] 1.0 implementation for `lua` and `luajit`.

Compatible with lua 5.1 >= 5.4 luajit 2.0 and luajit 2.1.0-beta3

## Features

* Implements the complete OSC 1.0 specification.
* Pure lua implementation, portable.
* Support for extended OSC types
* Transport layers implemented as plugins.

## Basic usage

```lua
local losc = require'losc'
local udp = require'losc.plugins.udp-socket'

-- Configure
upd.options = {
  sendAddr = 'localhost',
  sendPort = 57120,
}

-- Register to use lua-socket UDP plugin
losc:use(udp)

-- Create a message
local message = losc.new_message({
  address = '/foo/bar',
  types = 'ifsb',
  123, 1.234, 'hi', 'blobdata'
})

-- Send it over UDP
losc:send(message)
```

## API

The API is divided into two parts - a high level (opaque) and a low level based on plain lua tables.

The two API:s are decoupled from each other which makes it possible to
implement new high level API:s on top of the serialization functions if needed.

Read more about it in the [documentation][docs].
