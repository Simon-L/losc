[OSC][osc] 1.0 implementation for `lua` and `luajit`.

Compatible with lua 5.1 >= 5.4 luajit 2.0 and luajit 2.1.0-beta3

## Features

* Implements the complete OSC 1.0 specification.
* Pure lua implementation, no platform dependent libraries.
* Support for extended OSC types.
* Plugin system for transport layers.
* Address pattern matching.
* Scheduled bundle evaluation (plugin dependent).

## Basic usage

```lua
local losc = require'losc'
local plugin = require'losc.plugins.udp-socket'

local udp = plugin.new { sendAddr = 'localhost', sendPort = 9000 }
local osc = losc.new { plugin = udp }

-- Create a message
local message = osc.new_message {
  address = '/foo/bar',
  types = 'ifsb',
  123, 1.234, 'hi', 'blobdata'
}

-- Send it over UDP
osc:send(message)
```

## API

The API is divided into two parts:

1. Opaque high level API exposed through the `losc.lua` module.
2. Low level API exposing serialization/deserialization functions and types based on plain lua tables.

The two API:s are decoupled from each other which makes it possible to
implement new high level API:s on top of the low level API functions if needed.

Read more about it in the [documentation][docs].

## Benchmarks

Generated with lua 5.1.5 (using `struct`) running on a 2.3 GHz Intel i5 processor.

### Note on performance

The OSC serialization functions are implemented differently depending on the
lua interpreter in use and locally available packages. `losc` will always work
out-of-the-box regardless of lua version since
[`lua-struct`](https://github.com/iryont/lua-struct) is a bundled dependency.

To achieve **better performance** for lua versions < 5.3 it is
recommended to install the [`struct`](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/struct/) package locally.
